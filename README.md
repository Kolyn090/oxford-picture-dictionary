# Introduction

The Oxford Picture Dictionary was made based on 
[The New Oxford Picture Dictionary: Monolingual English Edition](https://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~karchung/OxfordPictureDictionary.pdf)
by Parnwell et al. at Oxford University Press. In the first paragraph
of the Preface, the authors have described the book as:

> The *New Oxford Picture Dictionary* contextually illustrates over
2,400 words. The book is a unique language learning tool for
students of English. It provides students a glance at American
lifestyle, as well as compendium of useful vocabulary.

### In this project, I have:
* Greatly improved image resolution by utilizing [AI Image enhancement](https://letsenhance.io/boost)
* Made numbered tags interactive
* Implemented pan and pinch
* Made vocabulary audible
* Implemented multilingual feature

### Using Oxford Picture Dictionary
The Oxford Picture Dictionary is designed for easy use. 
Simply click a numbered tag on the image to display the vocabulary, 
along with its pronunciation.
